## Overview
### Description
Application allow users to input information regarding various deals in their neighborhood. Users can then view other crowdsourced information and proceed to vote and comment on each item.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social/Lifestyle/Sharing/Finance
- **Mobile:** Our app is optimally used in a mobile setting where users are actively on the move. Users are not simply limited to mobile use as they can preplan their shopping before leaving the house. We will use camera functions, and gps location tracking to assist with our app.
- **Story:** Our app was developed to help ease the economic pains that are endured during their shopping experience. Considering todays economic climate, we wanted to create an app that would help stretch their dollar further. Fighting inflation one user at a time.

- **Market:** The potential userbase for IOS Deals is anybody who steps into the grocery store. The idea environment for our app would be highly populated cities, where we can have a higher number of users that would be willing to populate our data. Our core market would be money concious shoppers.

- **Habit:** We expect that the majority of users would not be willing to post or engage with the app. To encourage users to post IOS Deals rewards users who contribute to the system by awarding them with a point system which can lead badges, or coupons they can redeem. Or cold hard cash. 

- **Scope:** The base application with the required stories should engage the audience and appear to be feasible to implement within a constrained period of time. The additional optional stories may take extensive research to evaluate implementation strategies and will be prioritized if time allows.
